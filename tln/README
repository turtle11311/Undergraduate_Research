1. The description of TLN starts from Line 7.
2. Each line starts with the node name and the threshold value, followed by the fanin names and the corresponding weights.
3. In a line, if the threshold value and all the weights are 0, the node is a buffer or a PO. It is not accounted for the total threshold logic gate count.
4. The sum of total weights and threshold values, and the gate count are listed at the last two lines.
